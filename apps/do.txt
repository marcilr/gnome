GNOME Do
========
GNOME Do (also known as simply Do) is a popular free application launcher for 
Linux by David Siegel.  Unlike other application launchers, it not only allows
you to search for applications and files but it also allows you to specify 
actions to perform on search results by providing instantaneous, 
action-oriented search results that adapt to reflect user habits and 
preferences.

While it is designed primarily for the GNOME desktop, it works in other desktop 
environments, such as KDE.

GNOME Do was inspired by Quicksilver for Mac OS X, and GNOME Launch Box.
