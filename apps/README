paralogger.txt
  Paralogger is a script to "tail" the system logs in borderless
  transparent Eterm(s).  Its purpose is to make setting up a
  "root tail" an easy set and forget.  Paralogger makes the
  placement of the terminals (geometry) more friendly for the
  user by detecting the screen resolution and calculating the
  geometry of the terminals automatically. It can also load or
  save a configuration file.
