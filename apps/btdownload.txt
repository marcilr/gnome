gnome-btdownload - Gnome interface for 'executing' BitTorrent files


Thu Aug 20 08:09:21 AKDT 2009
=============================
Installed gnome-btdownload on boothite workstation Thu May 26, 2011 for 
pulling down torrents.  Easy install.  Created symlink from 
/usr/bin/gnome-btdownload to /usr/local/bin/btdownload for ease of use.


Example
=======
$ btdownload KNOPPIX_V6.0.1CD-2009-02-08-EN.torrent

This pops up a gnome window with the download.

Works good.

gnome-btdownload
A Gnome MIME-sink for BitTorrent files.
This utility allows Gnome browsers to handle BitTorrent files naturally.
Once it is installed, browsers will automatically pass bittorrent files
to this utility and it will start to download the file.
