What is Gnome Launch Box?
=========================
Launch Box is generally an application launcher.  It's very influenced by 
Quicksilver for Mac OSX.  It is written for the GNOME 2.10 or newer platform 
and depends on GTK+ 2.6 or newer, evolution-data-server 1.2 or newer and 
gnome-menus. These are currently hard dependencies but the plan is to split 
out the backends into different optional backends.  Currently supported 
modules are:

  Application starting and launch
  Evolution contacts lookup and mail to
  Recent files lookup and open
  Files in your desktop and open
  Firefox bookmarks lookup and opening 

Launch Box is the result of a Hackathon at Imendio in the weekend 8th-10th 
of January (of some years ago).  The hackers participating where Anders 
Carlsson, Mikael Hallendal, Michael Natterer and Richard Hult.

Sven Herzberg took over the project around 2007-2008 and is now the leader.
