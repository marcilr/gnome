If you want to keep an interface closer to the GNOME 2.30
version in wheezy, you can select the "GNOME Classic"
session at the login prompt.  It will bring you an improved
version of the traditional panel.  You can still edit the
panel to add more applets, by using the hidden alt+right
click combination.

Use "GNOME Classic" at login!  This provides the
Applications drop-down rather than the useless Activities
drop down.  Also has the Computer, home, and Trash on left 
where they should be.  Noticed on malachite they got moved
to the right display display in GNOME 3.  The classic
setting is held from login to login.  Thank goodness
the classic style is easily available.  Nuff said.


For modifying extensions see:
  $ gnome-tweak-tool > Shell Extensions

Get GNOME 3.x version (debian wheezy 7.8 amd64):
  $ gnome-session --version
  gnome-session 3.4.2.1
  $
