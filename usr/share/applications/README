Desktop entries for applications, or .desktop files, are generally
a combination of meta information resources and a shortcut of an
application. These files usually reside in /usr/share/applications
or /usr/local/share/applications for applications installed
system-wide, or ~/.local/share/applications for user-specific
applications. User entries take precedence over system entries.
