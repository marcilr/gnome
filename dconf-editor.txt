dconf-editor - Configuration Editor


dconf is a low-level configuration system and settings management.
Its main purpose is to provide a back end to GSettings on platforms
that don't already have configuration storage systems.  It depends
on GLib. It is part of GNOME 3 and is a replacement for GConf.

Run as root to display icons on desktop in gnome 3.

alt-f2 - run application prompt

Looks like gnome > desktop > applications > background

However, when icons were missing from displays 2,3,4 on GCI Network
Services, OSS workstation the solution was to delete ~/.cache and
logout/login.  That did the trick.
