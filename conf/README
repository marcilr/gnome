  dconf-editor - Configuration Editor
  dconf is a low-level configuration system and settings management.
  Its main purpose is to provide a back end to GSettings on platforms
  that don't already have configuration storage systems.  It depends
  on GLib. It is part of GNOME 3 and is a replacement for GConf.
