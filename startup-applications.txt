Startup Applications


For gnome 3.12 startup applications see ~/.config/autostart/*
Appears to have configuration that gnome-tweak-tool is modifying.

In cairo-dock.desktop I updated:

Exec=cairo-dock
  to
Exec=/home/marcilr/bin/cairo-dock

Gnome used to have startup applications under
  Applications > System Tools > Preferences > Startup Applications
  (FIXME: need to verify above path on malachite)

In gnome 3.12 gnome-session-properties that implemented Startup Applications, part of
gnome-session, got deprecated in favor of the Startup Applications tab in the gnome-tweak-took
3.12.
