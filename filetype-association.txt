To get gnome to launch  *.rdp files to launch grdesktop automatedly
set the filetype association in gnome:

"To change filetype associations in Gnome, right-click a file of the type 
whose associations you want to change and choose 'Properties'.

To change the default icon for that filetype, click the icon.  Then use 
the Gnome common file-open dialog to locate the icon you would like to use.

To change the default viewer for that filetype, click the 'Open With' tab, 
and select the application with which you would like to open files of this 
type by default. To add an application to this list, click the 'Add' button. 
The 'Add Application' dialog will give you a larger list of applications to 
choose from. If you still do not see the application with which you would 
like to open files of this filetype by default, choose 'Use a custom command'.
and type the path to the default viewer of your choice (e.g.: /usr/bin/vlc) 
or use the 'Browse' button to choose that application with the Gnome 
common file-open dialog."
