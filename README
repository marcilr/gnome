GNOME is a graphical interface for debian.
Configuration details here.

The GNOME Project was started in 1997 by two then university students,
Miguel de Icaza and Federico Mena.  Their aim: to produce a free (as
in freedom) desktop environment.  Since then, GNOME has grown into a
hugely successful enterprise.  Used by millions of people across the
world, it is the most popular desktop environment for GNU/Linux and
UNIX-type operating systems.  The desktop has been utilised in
successful, large-scale enterprise and public deployments, and the
project's developer technologies are utilised in a large number of
popular mobile devices.
