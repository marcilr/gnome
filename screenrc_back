# backtick id lifespan autorefresh cmd args...
# [...]
# Program the backtick command with the numerical id id.  The output
# of such a command is used for substitution of the "%‘" string
# escape. The specified lifespan is the number  of seconds the output
# is considered valid. After this time, the command is run again if a
# corresponding string escape is encountered. The autorefresh parame‐
# ter triggers an automatic refresh for caption and hardstatus strings
# after the specified number of seconds. Only the last line of output
# is used for substitution. If both the lifespan and the autorefresh
# parameters are zero, the backtick program is expected to stay in the
# background and generate output once in a while.  In this case, the
# command is executed right away and screen stores the last line of
# output. If a new line gets printed screen will automatically refresh
# the hardstatus or the captions.
